Gettysburg Address by Abraham Lincoln

Four score and seven years ago our father brought forth on this continent a new nation, concieved in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are create equal.

Now we are engaged in a civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so concieved and so dedicated, can long endure. 
We are met on a great battlefield of that war.
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who gave their lives that that nation might live.
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate -- we cannot consecrate -- we cannot hallow this ground.
The brave men, living and dead, who struggled her have consecrated it far above our poor ability to add or detract.
The world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here.
It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work that those who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
It is, rather, for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that we take from these honored dead increased devotion to that cause for which they gave their last full measure of devotion.
That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain,
that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom,
and that goverenment of the people, by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
